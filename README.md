# Simple-Neural-Networks

This is a raw python implementation of a fairly simple neural network. No frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch or math libraries like NumPy are used. 
Neural Networks are highly popular machine learning techniques that are especially used in classification. There are many kinds of neural networks but this particular implementation is called a Feed Forward Backpropagation Neural Network. Feed Forward refers to the fact that each network in a layer is connected to each neuron in the next layer and signals travel in the forward direction only. Backpropagation is a learning technique where the weights of individual neurons are adjusted while traveling backwards through the network.
